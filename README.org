#+TITLE: indian-ext
#+AUTHOR: Patrick McAllister

This package provides extensions to the standard Emacs ind-util.el
functions.


It is currently focused on providing methods for Sanskrit, but that
might (and hopefully will) change in the future.

It defines the following extra decode/encode functions:


- between Velthuis and Devanāgarī:
  - `indian-ext-dev-velthuis-encode-region'
  - `indian-ext-dev-velthuis-decode-region'
- between SLP1 and Devanāgarī:
  - `indian-ext-dev-slp1-encode-region'
  - `indian-ext-dev-slp1-decode-region'
- between IAST and Devanāgarī:
  - `indian-ext-dev-iast-encode-region'
  - `indian-ext-dev-iast-decode-region'

The IAST and Velthuis are not case sensitive.

It also defines an additional input method, sanskrit-iast (use with
`M-x set-input-method').

You can find other input methods here:

- Including Karoṣṭhī: http://stefanbaums.com/unicode/sanskrit.el
- Requires login: http://indica-et-buddhica.org/repositorium/software/emacs-utf8-input-framework


* As a library

There are functions to use these extensions in emacs-lisp programs:

- between Velthuis and Devanāgarī:
  - `indian-ext-dev-velthuis-encode-string'
  - `indian-ext-dev-velthuis-decode-string'
- between SLP1 and Devanāgarī:
  - `indian-ext-dev-slp1-encode-string'
  - `indian-ext-dev-slp1-decode-string'
- between IAST and Devanāgarī:
  - `indian-ext-dev-iast-encode-string'
  - `indian-ext-dev-iast-decode-string'


Speed is an issue, however:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (benchmark-run
      (dotimes (x 500)
	(indian-ext-dev-iast-encode-string "ख.")))

  ;; (4.902170626 30 4.18154369399997) most of the time seems to be
  ;; spent in ‘regex-opt’, called by ‘indian-regexp-of-hashtbl-keys’

  ;; and for comparison:

  (benchmark-run
      (dotimes (x 500)
	(with-temp-buffer
	  (insert "ख.")
	  (goto-char (point-min))
	  (while (re-search-forward "ख" nil t)
	    (replace-match "kha"))
	  (buffer-substring-no-properties (point-min) (point-max)))))
